PHPcheckmate
============

phpcheckmate is a chess framework written in php. Providing moves validation and game recording allowing us to tack pieces back. The project is object oriented and contains several classes. phpcheckmate is a php portage of the piece of code written in Perl by Brian Richardson.  This library originally by David Soyez, but I cannot seem to get in contact with him, so I am taking over the project here on GitHub.
